      <h1>CS1300: Development Assignment Handin</h1>

      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The development assignment had two main objectives. First, students were
        asked to perform a competitive analysis of three different websites
        featuring a favoriting function. Second, we were tasked with
        implementing a similar website using React components and props,
        incorporating functionality features such as sorting, filtering, and
        aggregating. Throughout the project, I carefully analyzed three
        platforms to develop a competitive comparison chart, through which I
        learned how those platforms designed their 'liking,' sorting, filtering,
        and aggregating functionalities.Then, I used react to develop a simple
        webapp with similar functionality features.
      </p>

      <h3>Development</h3>
      <p>
        React, HTML, CSS, Next.js, and Vercel are used for development and
        deployment. Item data and images are mock data stored in a JSON file
        since backend implementation was not within the scope of the project.
      </p>

      <h2>Part1: Competitive Analysis</h2>
      <h4>Three Websites</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/">Spotify</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">Airbnb</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Note: For the three platforms, you should log in to see the aggregator
        and like features with full workflow.
      </p>

      <p>
        After selecting the three platforms, general workflow of "favoriting" or
        saving items on each platform was examined resulting in the following
        competitive comparison chart below.
      </p>

      <h4>Competitive Comparison Chart</h4>
      <img src="images/Frame 17.png" alt="" />
      <h4>Chart Overview:</h4>
      <p>
        Overall, the user journey of "liking" or "saving" items on the three
        platforms differs based on what they are optimizing for. Specifically,
        YouTube and Spotify offer comprehensive sorting and collection workflows
        for users’ playlists which contain songs or videos. In contrast,
        Airbnb—focusing on the initial browsing and searching experience—has
        minimal sorting and customization options for personal "wishlists". For
        all three, the overall processes of liking or "saving" items are
        effectively identical; users select the like or save button and decide
        on the playlist or wishlist. <br />
        <br />
        The most successful features arise from addressing users' primary needs
        for each platform. For Spotify, advanced sorting options within users'
        playlists (collections of liked songs) by mood and vibe—e.g., upbeat,
        classy, etc.—in addition to conventional sorting by artist name, album,
        and recent, enable users to quickly revisit their favorites that fit
        their current states(<b
          >Optimizing for "F" skim pattern and idea of continuity</b
        >). On the other hand, Airbnb offers a map view on the right side of the
        wishlist, which enables users to check proximity along with prices(<b>
          connects back to proximity grouping principle</b
        >), despite no sorting or search within the lists. For YouTube, the
        customizability and sorting functionalities lie between Spotify and
        Airbnb. However, YouTube’s user playlist's option to sort by popularity,
        recent, or manual sorting reflects the users' primary goal of consuming
        viral or relevant video content. <br />
        <br />
        For Spotify, aggregated lists of podcasts lack advanced sorting, which
        can be inefficient when users save many podcast episodes. Similarly,
        Airbnb's lack of integrated sorting or search functionalities within
        their wishlists can result in a suboptimal user experience if users have
        liked or saved many candidates (although this could be intentional,
        coupled with the initial search and browsing experience).
      </p>

      <h4>My Development Goals & Inspirations</h4>
      <p>
        From the analysis, I quickly learned that sorting and filtering should
        be optimized for the user's main goal for the particular platform or
        service. However, sorting by fundamental attributes such as prices or
        ratings is an important requirement. By examining the commonalities as
        well as differences, I developed specifications that meet the project
        requirements, which are explained in detail in the next section.

    <h2>Part2: Development</h2>
    <h3>About Dave's Book Club</h3>
    <p>
      After performing the competitive analysis in part 1, I have learned about
      the fundamental features a platform needs to support aggregating,
      filtering, and sorting. Since the objective of the assignment is to
      utilize front-end skills (making use of props, components, and states), I
      have decided to develop a simple book listing website. On the website,
      visitors can view a list of books from my favorites as well as some
      bestseller books I found on Amazon. <br />

      <br />
      To meet the functionality requirements, users can filter books based on
      two categories: book format (Kindle vs. paper) and source of
      recommendation (Dave's Favorites vs. Amazon Bestsellers). Users can also
      sort the list by various attributes such as publication date, price, and
      rating in ascending or descending order. Liking a book by pressing the
      heart icon will simply add the book to your favorites list. When one
      presses the 'add to cart' button, the cart aggregator will be updated.
